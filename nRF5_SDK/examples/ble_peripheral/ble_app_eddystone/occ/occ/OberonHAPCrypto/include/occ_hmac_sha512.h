 * HMAC-SHA512 algorithm.
 *
 * The input message @p in is authenticated using the key @p k. The computed

 * received authenticator.

 * @param[out] r       HMAC output.
 * @param      key     HMAC key.
 * @param      key_len Length of @p key. 0 <= @p key_len <= @c occ_hmac_sha512_KEY_BYTES_MAX.
 * @param      in      Input data.
 * @param      in_len  Length of @p in.
