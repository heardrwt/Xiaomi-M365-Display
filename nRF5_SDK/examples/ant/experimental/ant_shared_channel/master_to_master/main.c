 * @brief Example of ANT Auto Shared Channel (ASC) Master.
 *
 * Before compiling this example for NRF52, complete the following steps:
 * - Download the S212 SoftDevice from <a href="https://www.thisisant.com/developer/components/nrf52832" target="_blank">thisisant.com</a>.
 * - Extract the downloaded zip file and copy the S212 SoftDevice headers to <tt>\<InstallFolder\>/components/softdevice/s212/headers</tt>.
 * If you are using Keil packs, copy the files into a @c headers folder in your example folder.
 * - Make sure that @ref ANT_LICENSE_KEY in @c nrf_sdm.h is uncommented.
