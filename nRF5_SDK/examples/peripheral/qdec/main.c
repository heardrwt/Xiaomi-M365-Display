* @brief QDEC example application main file.
*
* This is an example quadrature decoder application.
* The example requires that the QDEC A,B inputs are connected with the QENC A,B outputs and
* the QDEC LED output is connected with the QDEC LED input.
*
* The example uses the software quadrature encoder simulator QENC.
* The quadrature encoder simulator uses one channel of the GPIOTE module.
* The state of the encoder changes on the inactive edge of the sampling clock generated by the LED output.
*
* In an infinite loop, QENC produces a variable number of positive and negative pulses
* synchronously with bursts of clock impulses generated by QDEC at the LED output.
* The pulses are counted by QDEC operating in a REPORT mode.
* The pulses counted by QDEC are compared with the pulses generated by QENC.
* The test stops if there is a difference between the number of pulses counted and generated.
