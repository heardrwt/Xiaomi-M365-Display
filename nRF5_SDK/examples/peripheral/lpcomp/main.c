 * @brief LPCOMP example application main file.
 *
 * This is an example low power comparator application.
 * The example requires that LPCOMP A,B inputs are connected with QENC A,B outputs and
 * LPCOMP LED output is connected with LPCOMP LED input.
 *
 * Example uses software quadrature encoder simulator QENC.
 * Quadrature encoder simulator uses one channel of GPIOTE module.
 * The state of the encoder changes on the inactive edge of the sampling clock generated by LED output.
 *
 * In a infinite loop QENC produces variable number of positive and negative pulses
 * synchronously with bursts of clock impulses generated by LPCOMP at LED output.
 * The pulses are counted by LPCOMP operating in a REPORT mode.
 * Pulses counted by LPCOMP are compared with pulses generated by QENC.
 * The tests stops if there is a difference between number of pulses counted and generated.
