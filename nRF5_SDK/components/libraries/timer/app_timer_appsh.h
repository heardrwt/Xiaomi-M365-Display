 * @param[in]  PRESCALER        Value of the RTC1 PRESCALER register. This will decide the
 *                              timer tick rate. Set to 0 for no prescaling.
 * @param[in]  OP_QUEUES_SIZE   Size of queues holding timer operations that are pending execution.
 * @param[in]  USE_SCHEDULER    TRUE if the application is using the app_scheduler,
 *                              FALSE otherwise.
 *
 * @note Since this macro allocates a buffer, it must only be called once (it is OK to call it
 *       several times as long as it is from the same location, e.g. to do a reinitialization).
