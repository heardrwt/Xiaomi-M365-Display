*** Features
************
 
** BLE **
- Eddystone implementation upgraded from experimental to production quality.
 
*** Bugfixes
***********
** Drivers and libraries **
- Fixed a bug in FDS where fds_record_update() did not set the page on which the record was stored as applicable for garbage collection.
- Fixed a bug in FDS where optimization for size in GCC would cause a variable to not be word aligned which resulted in FDS_ERR_UNALIGNED_ADDR when attempting some flash operations.
- Fixed a bug in FDS where updating the firmware with DFU to a firmware with different flash settings could cause a missing swap page to fail to be detected.
- Fixed a bug in SAADC where calling nrf_saadc_int_enable() would enable the wrong interrupt.
- Fixed a bug in SAADC where optimization in Keil would cause nrf_drv_saadc_abort() to time out.
- Fixed a bug in SAADC where certain conditions would cause only the first convertion to succeed.
- Fixed a bug in Peer Manager which made it possible for Peer Manager to corrupt the flash memory under certain circumstances.
- Fixed a bug in NRF Timer where a bit width 8 would fail a validation check for Timer 1 and Timer 2.
 
** BLE **
- Changed the device name to "Nordic_Buttonless" and enabled write property on DFU Service Control Point.
  
*** Known Issues
****************
  
** Overall **
- Updating the MDK requires to manually copy the header and linker files
  into the SDK folder (ARM Keil uVision 4, IAR Workbench, ARMGCC).
- When uploading an application to an nRF52 IC using nrfjprog, you must
  provide the "--reset/-r" argument or powercycle the board.
- RTX is not supported on nRF52 chips.
  
** BLE **
- Some examples might have excessively verbose logging.
- In the Proximity Application, writing "High Alert" to the AlertLevel
  characteristic of the Link Loss Service does not trigger a high alert
  when the link is lost.
- When an Android device is used as a peripheral, it sends slave
  security request with the MITM bit set. The central applications in
  the SDK will reject the security request (Pairing Failed) because
  they do not support MITM.
  
** NFC **
- NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
- Type 2 Tag on nRF52840 chips might fail unpredictably.
- Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag ("NFC Tool" seems to be okay to use).

*** Changes
************
 
** Overall **
- Changed the default interrupt priorities for nRF52 to be the same as
  the SoftDevice event priority.
- Prefixed error codes with "NRF_".
- Fixed a bug in the clock driver where the driver was failing to handle 
  two requests coming from the same source.
- Removed nRF52 support for RTX. RTX is now supported on nRF51 chips 
  only.
- Updated the example Secure DFU images. They are now created with the
  debug flag enabled.
- Modified the SoftDevice header files nrf_soc.h and nrf_nvic.h to
  support PCA10056 (nRF52840).
- Split up the files located in the examples\bsp folder to new locations:
  components\libraries\bsp and components\boards.
 
** Drivers and libraries **
- Updated the RNG driver so that it supports the SoftDevice being
  enabled and disabled. Removed the function nrf_drv_rng_pool_capacity().
- Changed the API for function app_button_is_pushed() (located in
  app_button.h).
- Extended the app_gpiote API to support more than 32 pins. Removed 
  unimplemented functions from the API.
- Extended the nrf_gpio API to support more than 32 pins. Removed 
  functions that referred to 8-bit ports (for example, 
  nrf_gpio_port_read).
- Removed the function nrf_drv_adc_gpio_to_ain() from the 
  nrf_drv_adc API.
- Removed the function nrf_drv_comp_gpio_to_ain() from the 
  nrf_drv_comp API.
- Removed the function nrf_drv_saadc_gpio_to_ain() from the 
  nrf_drv_saadc API.
  
** BLE **
- Fixed an issue that would cause some central examples to fail when
  restarting scanning using a whitelist.
- Updated the Peer Manager modules to return NRF_ERROR_STORAGE_FULL
  instead of NRF_ERROR_NO_MEM.
- The field "peer_id" in the Peer Manager structure
  "pm_peer_data_bonding_t" has been renamed to "peer_ble_id".
- Fixed an issue where the Database Discovery Module would not
  re-initialize properly upon successive discoveries.
- Fixed an issue where the Database Discovery Module would fail to
  discover the extended properties descriptor and the characteristic
  user description descriptors.
- Fixed an issue where the Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS)
  example application could crash if the connecting iPhone disconnected
  immediately after connecting.
 
** NFC **
- Modified the Adafruit NFC Shield library to support reading Type 2 and
  Type 4 Tags.
- Improved performance of the Adafruit library in Type 2 Tag reader mode
  (faster read).
- Added LE Secure Connections OOB values encoding in ble_pair_msg.
- Enabled dynamic update of the TK value in ble_pair_msg.
 
 
*** Known Issues
****************
 
** Overall **
- Updating the MDK requires to manually copy the header and linker files
  into the SDK folder (ARM Keil uVision 4, IAR Workbench, ARMGCC).
- When uploading an application to an nRF52 IC using nrfjprog, you must
  provide the "--reset/-r" argument or powercycle the board.
- RTX is not supported on nRF52 chips.
 
** BLE **
- Some examples might have excessively verbose logging.
- In the Proximity Application, writing "High Alert" to the AlertLevel
  characteristic of the Link Loss Service does not trigger a high alert
  when the link is lost.
- When an Android device is used as a peripheral, it sends slave
  security request with the MITM bit set. The central applications in
  the SDK will reject the security request (Pairing Failed) because
  they do not support MITM.
- Eddystone Beacon Application:
   - Advertisement intervals are not verified. Clients must ensure that
     the configured advertisement interval is within the valid range.
     Note that EID/eTLM configurations might require advertisement
     intervals larger than the default value.
   - Caution: On nRF51 devices, eTLM calculation takes around 500 ms
     and is performed once per EID slot in the same interrupt level
     priority as the 'Unlock' functionality. Therefore, if multiple EID
     slots and an eTLM slot are configured, the client might not be able
     to unlock a beacon that has an eTLM slot and uses the default
     advertisement interval. To resolve this issue, increase the
     advertisement interval.
- Buttonless DFU Template Application (experimental):
   - The project setup of the example is wrong and does not fit into the
     available space below the DFU bootloader. To fix this problem, 
     change the IROM1 size from 0x61000 to 0x59000. In addition, comment
     out the code section that reserves a codepage at 0x7E000 for MBR 
     parameters. For details, see  
     https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/100609/sdk-12-bootloader-erased-after-programming/
   - To switch to DFU mode, you must write to the DFU control point. 
     However, this characteristic is set as read only. Add the following
     code line to enable the write property:
       char_md.char_props.write = 1;
     For details, see
     https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/93414/sdk12-ble_app_buttonless_dfu/#95079 

 
** NFC **
- NFC Type 2 and Type 4 Tag HAL modules require using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
- Type 2 Tag on nRF52840 chips might fail unpredictably.
- Some mobile phone apps cannot write Type 4 Tag ("NFC Tool" seems to be
  okay to use).

For other devices and boards, see the SDK documentation, section "Using the SDK with other boards".
 
*** New features
****************
** Overall **
- Serialization of the S132 SoftDevice v3.0.
  

*** Changes
***********
 
** Overall **
- Includes the latest Nordic MDK v8.9.0.
- Small documentation updates.
 

*** Known issues
****************
  
** Overall **
- Updating the MDK requires to manually copy the header and linker files
  into the SDK folder (ARM Keil uVision 4, IAR Workbench, ARMGCC).
- When uploading an application to an nRF52 IC using nrfjprog, you must
  provide the "--reset/-r" argument or powercycle the board.
 
** BLE **
- When performing service discoveries after a reconnect,
  ble_db_discovery might fail to initialize. Refer to this link for a fix:
  https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/92452/nrf52-ble_db_discovery-failed-to-initialize-correctly-when-repeats-the-service-discovery/
- The "UART/Serial Port Emulation over BLE" (ble_app_uart) example
  does not compile with nrf_log enabled (missing nrf_log sources)  
- Some examples might have excessively verbose logging.
- Performing pairing without bonding will cause examples to assert. To
  fix this, make sure the call to pm_peer_rank_highest() during
  PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_SUCCEEDED happens only when the procedure is
  PM_LINK_SECURED_PROCEDURE_BONDING.
- When an Android device is used as a peripheral, it sends slave
  security request with the MITM bit set. The central applications in
  the SDK will reject the security request (Pairing Failed) because
  they do not support MITM.
  
** Secure DFU **
 - nRF Toolbox for iPhone:
   - When an error occurs, nRF Toolbox does not automatically
     disconnect. You must therefore reset the board manually to
     disconnect before you can connect again.
   - It is not possible to abort a transfer when the device connection
     is lost.
   - On resumption, nRF Toolbox does not call execute, which makes it
     impossible to resume a transfer.
   - When transferring a combined SoftDevice and bootloader image, the
     bootloader might not be updated.
   - On nRF52 devices, the DFU operation is sometimes reported as
     completed, even though the device is not updated.
 
** NFC **
- NFC Type 2 Tag HAL requires using TIMER4 on nRF52832.

  into the SDK folder (ARM Keil uVision 4, IAR Workbench, ARMGCC).
- When uploading an application to an nRF52 IC using nrfjprog, you must 
  provide the "--reset/-r" argument or powercycle the board.

** BLE **
- Some examples might have excessively verbose logging.
- Performing pairing without bonding will cause examples to assert. To 
  fix this, make sure the call to pm_peer_rank_highest() during 
  PM_EVT_CONN_SEC_SUCCEEDED happens only when the procedure is 
  PM_LINK_SECURED_PROCEDURE_BONDING.
- When an Android device is used as a peripheral, it sends slave 
  security request with the MITM bit set. The central applications in 
  the SDK will reject the security request (Pairing Failed) because 
  they do not support MITM.
 
** Secure DFU **
 - nRF Toolbox for iPhone:
   - When an error occurs, nRF Toolbox does not automatically 
     disconnect. You must therefore reset the board manually to 
     disconnect before you can connect again.
   - It is not possible to abort a transfer when the device connection 
     is lost.
   - On resumption, nRF Toolbox does not call execute, which makes it 
     impossible to resume a transfer. 
   - When transferring a combined SoftDevice and bootloader image, the 
     bootloader might not be updated. 
   - On nRF52 devices, the DFU operation is sometimes reported as 
     completed, even though the device is not updated.

** NFC **
- NFC Type 2 Tag HAL requires using TIMER4 on nRF52832.

Compatibility:
The SoftDevices that are supported in this SDK are not compatible 
out-of-the-box with nRF52 Engineering A and Engineering B (the 
IC revisions present on all versions of PCA10036 and on PCA10040
v0.9.0).
However, you can use the latest SoftDevices on Engineering A and B 
nRF52 chips for development purposes if you implement the 
workaround for anomaly 73 (TIMER: Event lost, see 
http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.nrf52/dita/nrf52/errata.html).

*** Changes
***********
 
** Overall **
- Support for CMSIS Packs has been removed. The SDK is delivered as zip 
  file only.
 
** Drivers and libraries **
- The MSB and LSB macros have been renamed to MSB_32 and LSB_32. Code 
  using these macros should be changed to use either the 16- or the 
  32-bit variant.
 
** BLE **
- Multi-instance handling of Service client modules has been greatly 
  improved. The client examples now handle service discovery in the main
  application context. The main application context must manage which 
  client instance belongs to which connection link.
- The Multi-link Example has been modified to demonstrate multiple 
  client instances in a better way.
- The ble_app_multilink_peripheral example has been removed. 
  ble_app_blinky now acts as the peripheral for ble_app_multilink_central.
- Heart Rate Application with RTX: Support for nRF52 has been removed.
- The Peer Manager is no longer experimental.
- The following BLE examples now use Peer Manager:
    - Central: 
         Running Speed and Cadence Collector (ble_app_rscs_c)
    - Central and Peripheral: 
         BLE Relay (ble_app_hrs_rscs_relay)
         BLE LE Secure Connections Multirole (ble_app_multirole_lesc)
    - Peripheral: 
         Alert Notification (ble_app_alert_notification)
         Proximity (ble_app_proximity)
         Glucose (ble_app_gls)
         HID Keyboard Application with BLE pairing using NFC (experimental_ble_app_hids_keyboard_pairing_nfc)
- The behavior of Peer Manager and Device Manager has changed to reject 
  pairing requests from already bonded peer centrals.
- Several BLE peripheral examples now support the S332 SoftDevice.
- Minor bugfixes in DFU.
 
** ANT **
- The ANT bootloader was aligned to MBR version 2.0.0.
- The following ANT examples now support the S332 SoftDevice 
  (experimental):
    - ANT Bootloader/DFU
    - Message Types
 
** NFC **
- The Adafruit Tag Reader Example has been extended to show added NDEF 
  parsing functionality.
- The NFC Type 2 Tag HAL was improved with a workaround for supporting 
  low power mode.
 
** Proprietary **
- A new implementation of the Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) protocol 
  supporting both nRF51 and nRF52 has been added.
 
*** Fixed issues
****************
 
** Drivers and libraries **
- GPIOTE: Fixed the problem of lost events in low-accuracy sense toggle 
          mode
- SAADC: Added functionality to use one AIN with multiple channels
- UART: Fixed a glitch on TX pin when initializing the driver
- UART: Fixed the problem that TX bytes were sent in wrong order in 
        app_uart_fifo
 
** BLE **
- Removed a vulnerability in Peer Manager and Device Manager that would 
  allow malicious attackers to overwrite the bonding information of a 
  bonded device
 
** ANT **
- Fixed the handling of send-until-success request types in the ANT 
  request controller
- Fixed an ant_evt_t structure member alignment bug
 
** NFC **
- Fixed the NFC examples to work when the UART logger is enabled
- Fixed a buffer leakage bug in the module for creating 
  application/vnd.bluetooth.le.oob records
 
*** Known issues
****************
 
** Drivers and libraries **
- Using the NVIC API directly and not through a SoftDevice causes 
  problems, especially when NVIC_EnableIRQ or NVIC_DisableIRQ are called
  from critical sections.
 
** BLE **
- All BLE examples have been tested only on PCA10028 and PCA10040.
- BLE Examples that use pairing are incompatible with examples in SDK 
  version 6.1 and earlier that do not use pairing.
 
** ANT **
- Previous versions of the ANT DFU example are incompatible with the ANT
  S212/S332 SoftDevices version 0.9.x.
 
** NFC **
- NFCT requires using TIMER4 on nRF52832.
 
** FPU **
- When the FPU is in use, it triggers the FPU_IRQn interrupt when one of
  the six exception flags (IDC, IXC, UFC, OFC, DZC, IOC) is set.
  The FPU interrupt will always set the pending flag (even if the 
  interrupt is not enabled), irrespective of whether the user is 
  interested in the exception bit.
  The pending flag then prevents the SoftDevice from going into low 
  power mode when sd_app_evt_wait() is called.
  Therefore, always clear the exception bits and the pending interrupt 
  before calling sd_app_evt_wait(). See the code below for an example 
  implementation.
  FPU exception bit definition:
  http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0553a/BABBFJEC.html
  Example code:
  {
  // Set bit 7 and bits 4..0 in the mask to one (0x ...00 1001 1111)
  #define FPU_EXCEPTION_MASK 0x0000009F 
 
  ...
      /* Clear exceptions and PendingIRQ from the FPU unit */
      __set_FPSCR(__get_FPSCR()  & ~(FPU_EXCEPTION_MASK));      
      (void) __get_FPSCR();
      NVIC_ClearPendingIRQ(FPU_IRQn);
 
      /* Call SoftDevice Wait For event */
      error_code = sd_app_evt_wait();
  }

BLE:

  Changes:
  - All BLE examples have been tested only on PCA10028 and PCA10040.
  - The S13x SoftDevice v2.0.0-7.alpha is configurable, which leads to a
    variable RAM setup:
      - Added a macro to the softdevice_handler module to check the RAM 
        configuration against the SoftDevice parameters.
      - Added a wrapper function for the sd_enable function to the

  - Ported the Adafruit NFC library for the Adafruit PN532 Shield, which
    provides NFC Forum Device capabilities. Added an associated example
    to read tags.
  - Added modules to create application/vnd.bluetooth.le.oob records, 
    application/vnd.bluetooth.ep.oob records, ac records, Hs records, 
    and BLE pairing messages.

    For other devices and boards, see the SDK documentation, section "Using
    the SDK with other boards".
  
Changes:
    
  Drivers and libraries:
    New features:
        - Ported FreeRTOS to run on nRF51. Added two FreeRTOS examples: one
          to run on bare metal and one running a BLE HRS example using the 
          S110 and S130 SoftDevices.
        - Added a TWI transaction manager module for managing access to an 
          I2C bus. Added an example that uses this module to control two 
          sensors on the same I2C bus.
        - Added an example that shows how to use the TWI driver.
        - Added a low-power PWM module (software-controlled low-accuracy 
          PWM). Added an example that shows how to use this module.
        - Added an LED softblink module that uses the low-power PWM. Added 
          an example that shows how to use this module. 
        - Ported app_uart to use the UART driver and moved it to the 
          libraries folder.
        - Ported app_gpiote to use the GPIOTE driver.
        - Added nrf_log, a logging module that supports printf and that can
          use either UART or SEGGER RTT as transport medium.
    Fixed issues:
        - Mailbox module moved out of serialization.
        - Bug fixes in app_timer module.
        - App_timer module no longer requires to define the number of 
          timers used in the application.
        - Bug fixes in PWM module.
    Changes:
        - FIFO library: Extended APIs for multi-byte read and write to the 
          FIFO.
        - Memory Manager module:
                - Extended number of block categories to 7 (from 3).
                - More RAM-efficient management of memory blocks.
                - Added a diagnostic function to help determine the right 
                  configuration needed for the application.

  Serialization:
    New features:
     - Added a command for resetting the connectivity chip.
 
  ANT:
    New features:
     - Added the following new ANT modules: 
         - ant_encryption 
         - ant_key_manager
         - ant_search_config 
     - Extended/changed the following existing ANT modules:
         - ant_channel_config
         - ant_stack_config
         - ant_state_indicator      
     - Refactored the ANT/ANT+ examples and profiles to make them look more
       similar to the BLE profiles and examples:
         - The following ANT+ profiles have been extracted and extended: 
           Bicycle Power (ant_bpwr), Bicycle Speed & Cadence (ant_bsc), 
           Stride Based Speed & Distance (ant_sdm)
         - All ANT+ examples have been refactored to use extracted 
           profiles.
         - All ANT+/ANT examples have been refactored to use created 
           modules.
     - Added three new ANT examples:
         - ant_scalable
         - ant_scalable_encrypted
         - ant_scan_and_forward
 
    BLE:
     - Added an experimental module named Peer Manager. This module will 
       eventually replace the existing Device Manager. The new Peer Manager
       improves on the Device Manager in multiple ways, mainly by 
       supporting concurrent central and peripheral connections.
     - Added an experimental flash memory module named Flash Data Storage 
       (FDS), which greatly reduces the need for time-consuming write and 
       clear operations. When using FDS, data can be arbitrarily long or 
       short (within about a page). All pieces of data are tagged with 
       types, which makes it easy to version data.
     - Updated the experimental HRS/RSCS Relay example:
        - It now uses the new Peer Manager instead of the Device Manager. 
          Therefore, it now supports bonding in both central and peripheral
          roles.
        - It uses the new nrf_log module, which can use SEGGER RTT.
     - Removed the app_s130_demo example.
     - Added an experimental example supporting the Eddystone beacon 
       format.
     - Added the BLE Connection State module, which keeps track of certain 
       states of each connection (for example, whether it is encrypted) and
       can also keep track of user-defined states.
     - Added the Mapped Flags module, which keeps track of flags that are 
       mapped to keys. It is used by the BLE Connection State module.
     - Added ble_gatt_db.h (containing a GATT service structure) and 
       modified ble_db_discovery module to use it.
    BLE Services:
     - Updated the Bluetoothds_template application (experimental) to be 
       compatible with Bluetooth Developer Studio v1.0 and the Nordic 
       Semiconductor NRF5X v1.1.8 plugin.
     - Added three new services:
        - Location Navigation Service (experimental)
        - Proprietary LED Button Service (experimental)
        - Nordic UART Client Service (experimental)

Fixed issues:
     - App_pwm occasionally gives inverted signal.
  
Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multi-role S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on 
          S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum 
      connection interval of 11.25 ms. The application cannot handle 
      connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system 
      reset in the middle of a firmware update.
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware
                  update process, consider increasing the connection 
                  interval used by the master.
    - The old manual procedure for testing buttonless DFU, as specified in
      the documentation, can lead to the DFU process hanging or returning 
      an error when used with Master Control Panel 3.8 and newer.
    - Bootloader binaries (.bin files) generated with the GCC makefile 
      should not be used. Instead, generate the bootloader bin files using 
      nrfutils, found on GitHub.

      peripherial for both the chip version delivered with the nRF52 
      Preview Development Kit (Engineering A: QFAA-AA0, QFAA-AC0, 
      CGAA-AA0) and the chip version delivered with the nRF52 Development
      Kit (Engineering B: QFAA-BA0, QFAA-BB0, CHAA-AA0, CHAA-AB0).

Examples:
    - Added PCA10040 as target bord for the following examples:

      - NFC URL Record Application 

Known issues/workarounds:
    - To use the software workarounds implemented for PCA10036 (part 
      of nRF52 Preview Development Kit), globally define 
      HAL_NFC_ENGINEERING_A_FTPAN_WORKAROUND in your project.
    - The TIMER4 peripheral is used to implement one of the workarounds 
      for PCA10036. This workaround is not used for PCA10040.
    - The ble_app_hrs_pairing_nfc example is unable to wake up from 
      system off.
 
========================================================================

nRF52 SDK v0.9.1

      (without SoftDevice)
 
Limitations:
    - The current version of the NFC library uses TIMER4.
    - The ble_app_hrs_pairing_nfc example has been tested only with Samsung 
      Galaxy S6.
    - If the path to the SDK directory is too long, compilation in Keil fails. 
      To work around this problem, move the SDK higher in the folder tree 
      or use shorter folder names.

        Libraries:
            - Heart Rate Monitor Profile
            - ANT stack configuration
            - ANT channel configuration
            - ANT channel state indicator
            - ANT pulse simulator
         
        Examples:
            - The ANT HRM examples have been refactored.
            - The Bicycle Power examples (ant_bicycle_pwr) support S310.
  
    ANT + BLE (S310):
        The following examples were added:
        - Bluetooth LE and ANT combined heart rate example (ble_ant_app_hrm).
        - Experimental ANT Shared Channels (experimental_ant_shared_channel_master_to_master, 
          experimental_ant_shared_channel_slave).
 
    BLE:
     - Advertising module has a new mode: Low Duty Cycle Directed Advertising.
     - Running Speed and Cadence Client added as experimental.
     - Bluetooth Developer Studio template added as experimental.
     - Heart Rate Sensor example (ble_app_hrs) supports S310.
     - Running Speed and Cadence example (ble_app_rscs) supports S310.
     - Combined Peripheral and Central example added as experimental.
     - DFU Signing using Elliptic Curve Cryptography added as experimental
       (using the same elliptic curve and hashing algorithm as Bluetooth 
       Low Energy 4.2 Secure Connections).
 
Fixed issues:
     - Pstorage now supports updates of bond split across two pages.
     - Advertising module can be set to infinite time-out.
     - Corrected clock source in BLE multiactivity beacon example.
     - Serialization HCI transport layer: Receiving packet-buffer is not 
       freed while sending ACK or NACK.
  
Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multi-role S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on 
          S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum 
      connection interval of 11.25 ms. The application cannot handle 
      connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system 
      reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware 
         update process, consider increasing the connection interval used
         by the master.
    - App_pwm occasionally gives inverted signal.
    - The old manual procedure for testing buttonless DFU, as specified in
      the documentation, can lead to the DFU process hanging or returning 
      an error when used with Master Control Panel 3.8 and newer.

Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multirole S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
        Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
        increasing the connection interval.

    - ANT:
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time.

    - BLE:
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing 
          examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two 
          pages.

    - Proprietary:
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box 
          with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
          The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
              hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
              hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
              hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
              hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy 
          Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and 
          channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects 
              (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

            - IAR 7.20.2
        - The supported SoftDevices are now included in the SDK and can be flashed directly from
          Keil, as a separate target.

    ANT + BLE (dual stack):
        - Removed support for the S310 SoftDevice for BLE API compatibility reasons. For support, 
          use SDK v7.2.0.

    BLE:

              SoftDevices.
        - Modules/Services:
            - Added a new advertising module (ble_advertising) that provides automatic handling of
              directed/fast/slow advertising, with and without whitelist.
            - Nordic UART Service (ble_nus), detached from the UART over BLE Example.
            - Added Current Time Service Client (ble_cts_c).
            - Service Changed characteristic has been implemented for DFU, so that the indication is
              sent when transitioning between application and bootloader.
            - Implemented a mechanism for sharing of IRK and LTK from application to bootloader. 
              This allows for whitelist advertising and reconnection in DFU mode using existing 
              keys.
        - Examples:
            - The UART over BLE Example is no longer experimental.
            - Added a Time Profile (ble_app_cts_c) example using the Current Time Service Client
              implementation.

    - Fixed pstorage issue where different applications could write to the same page.

Known issues:
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.

        - Fixed memory corruption issue by using dedicated buffers for ANT and BLE stack events 
          respectively on S310
        - Fixed an issue where the ANT OTA Updater application v0.8 would not support hex files 
          with code size larger than 65535 bytes

Known issues:
    - SEGGER J-Link software has some issues with Keil. 
      See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for details.
    - Keil 5.13 may issue a warning about missing packs even when all Nordic Semiconductor packs are
      correctly installed. 
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
         increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    - ANT:
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time

    - BLE:
        - NRFFOSDK-3135: S120 examples: RAM is limited to 16 kB, because S120 V1.0.1 does not 
          support utilizing the whole flash on the QFACAB chip
        - NRFFOSDK-119: Only the ble_app_proximity_low_power and ble_app_hrs applications are power 
          optimized
        - S120 examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 
          examples is that if the peer loses the bond and a rebonding occurs, flash clear fails and
          a DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing 
          examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two 
          pages.

    - Proprietary:
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is a hardware-related issue
          described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box 
          with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
          The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy 
          Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and 
          channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects 
              (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Known issues:
    
    - When flashing from Keil 4, a pop-up might appear stating "Cannot Load Flash Device Description !".
          Solution:
            - Write new flash algorithm settings to the uvopt file. 
                Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
                Select "Options for Target" -> "Utilities".
                Press "Settings" button to see flashing algorithms.
                Verify that "nRF51xxx" is in the list of flashing algorithms, if not add it by pressing the "Add" button.
                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time. 

    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - S120 Examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if peer loses the bond and a re-bonding occurs, flash clear fails, and DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - Device manager has a few APIs unimplemented. Also documentation providing examples of how API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device manager (pstorage) doesn't support update of bond split across two pages.
        
    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Changes:

    - Added partial support for Keil 5 uvprojx files.

    ANT
        - None
        
    ANT + BLE (Dual stack)
    
    BLE
        - New module device manager replaces bond manager for storing persistent data
        - Experimental device manager support for s120 (BLE central)
        - S110 serialization solution has been reworked
            - 100% s110 BLE APIs are now serialized

        - Gazell: HW resources are reconfigured when Gazell is being enabled or exiting from suspend mode.
    
Fixed issues:
    
    - NRFFOSDK-2542 - SoftDevice related documentation for S110, S120 and S310 BLE stack is not consistent. When looking up SoftDevice application interface or message sequence charts, it is possible that one is looking at incorrect interface. Recommendation hence is to look at SoftDevice headers to ensure correct appplication interface. This is also applicable for Serialization library references. This will be fixed in next release.
        - SDK documentation has been splitted into 4 seperate documents with a common index page.
    
    ANT
        - None

    ANT + BLE (Dual stack)
        - S310 Heart Rate Relay Example: Bonding does not always function as expected. If bonding is enabled using compiler flag it is recommended to perform service discovery before bonding to minimize chances of unexpected behaviour.    

    BLE
        
    Proprietary
        - Enhanced ShockBurst/Gazell: Received packets in Host/PRX mode with CRC error can no longer return ACK to device.

Known issues:
    
    - When flashing from Keil 4, a pop-up might appear stating "Cannot Load Flash Device Description !".
          Solution:
            - Write new flash algorithm settings to the uvopt file. 
                Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
                Select "Options for Target" -> "Utilities".
                Press "Settings" button to see flashing algorithms.
                Verify that "nRF51xxx" is in the list of flashing algorithms, if not add it by pressing the "Add" button.
                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time. 

    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - S120 Examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if peer loses the bond and a re-bonding occurs, flash clear fails, and DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - Device manager has a few APIs unimplemented. Also documentation providing examples of how API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device manager (pstorage) doesn't support update of bond split across two pages.
        
    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".

                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Known issues:

    - When flashing from Keil 4, a pop-up might appear stating "Cannot Load Flash Device Description !".
          Solution:
            - Write new flash algorithm settings to the uvopt file. 
                Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
                Select "Options for Target" -> "Utilities".
                Press "Settings" button to see flashing algorithms.
                Verify that "nRF51xxx" is in the list of flashing algorithms, if not add it by pressing the "Add" button.
                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

  
    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time. 
      
    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - NRFFOSDK-472 - Bonding information in flash are not erased during programming of a new application.
            (If the bonding information is not erased manually - by pressing button 1 during start-up - the new application might assert. )
        - NRFFOSDK-2162 - Heart Rate application for PCA10001 possible inconsistent system attributes on power cycle. It is possible that the system attributes on power cycle are not consistent with the ones updated during previous connection.
       
    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

        - NRFFOSDK-1828: Key refresh was triggering a link failure when re-bonding to a master. This is now fixed.
        - NRFFOETT-571: Premature disconnection scenario handling added to bond manager. Previously this was resulting in system attributes of a master to be cleared.

    Proprietary
        - ESB: The nrf_esb_tx_failed() callback function was never called when dynamic acknowledgement was used. This is now fixed.

Known issues:
   
     - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.

    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    Proprietary:
	- NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:

            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

nRF51 SDK v. 4.3.0
------------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
    - ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.60
	- GCC: gcc-arm-embedded 4.7 2013q1
    - N51422 QFAACA on PCA10003 evaluation kit board
    - N51822 QFAACA on PCA10004/5 module on nRF6310 motherboard
    - Windows XP SP3 32 bit
    - Windows 7 SP1 64 bit
    - BLE SoftDevice Version : s110_nrf51822_5.2.0

Changes:

    - Supported GCC toolchain switched from CodeSourcery to gcc-arm-embedded.
        - New gcc startup file, linker scripts, and makefiles.
        - Updated CMSIS header files in Include/gcc to the latest revision (3.20).
        - Makefile target "all" now runs "clean" and "debug" targets instead of incremental "release" target.
    - nrf.h requires projects to have a define for a chip to enable some needed workarounds.
	- SDK examples now support PCA10000 v2.0.0. To make the examples work on the older PCA10000 v1.0, the UART pins need to be remapped in the pca10000.h header file.
		For v1.0
			#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  3
			#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  1
			#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 2
			#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 0
		For v2.0.0
			#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  11
			#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  9
			#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 10
			#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 8
    
    ANT
            - ANT examples have been updated to support the newest UART API.
    BLE
	    - HCI Transport Layer from Bluetooth Specification v4.0 introduced for BLE S110 Serialized Applications. 
		- BLE S110 Serialization Examples released as part of the main SDK.
		- Updated serialized ble_app_advertising and ble_app_hrs to use app_scheduler.
	    - Connection Parameter update module : Added possibility to request different connection parameters multiple times. A new event, BLE_CONN_PARAMS_EVT_SUCCEEDED has been created. Event handler implementation needs to take this into account, especially if they were implemented to trigger a disconnect regardless of the type of event.
		- Added Makefile and Eclipse project file for ble_app_hrs.
		- Changed hard coded flash pages to be FICR CODESIZE dependent.
           
    Proprietary
        - Gazell:
			- Added Gazell Pairing Host source code and board example. Backwards compatible with nRF24L Gazell Pairing Device and Host modules.
			- Added function nrf_gzll_set_auto_disable(uint32_t num_ticks), to disable Gazell after a number of timeslots.
			- Added function nrf_gzll_get_tick_count().
			- Gazell Pairing Device now uses nrf_gzll_get_tick_count() in order to implement a delay. This reduces current consumption.
			- Default sync_lifetime value has been increased to 3*channel_table_size*number_of_timeslots_per_channel. This improves performance in high-interference environments. Current users who are satisfied with the performance may wish to maintain the minimum value of 1*channel_table_size*number_of_timeslots_per_channel, in order to avoid any slight increase in current consumption.
        - Enhanced ShockBurst:
			- ESB PTX now calls nrf_esb_tx_success() callback instead of nrf_esb_tx_failed() for NOACK packets.
			- Fix in nrf_esb_set_mode() 
        - Information concerning backwards compatibility with nRF24L devices has been moved to the User Guide.
		
Fixed issues:

    - Examples doing flash writes were not waiting for writes to finish.
    
    ANT
	    - NRFFOSDK-1312 - Changed ANTFS_TRANSMIT_POWER define in antfs.h from 0 to 3. The define previously had an incorrect definition which set the power value to -20dBm instead of 0dBm even though the comment indicated 0dBm. 

    BLE
	    - NRFFOETT-402 - DFU Bootloader application in experimental project now sets stack pointer correctly before executing reset vector of application.

    Proprietary
	    - NRFFOETT-301 - Radio example uses obsolete RADIO_TXPOWER_TXPOWER_Neg40dBm definition.
        - Fixed issue in TWI HW driver. Event was not cleared before waiting it to get cleared.
        - Floating point ABI used by Makefiles was incorrect. Now using mabi-float=soft.
        - Gazell/ESB: Fixed set_mode() functionality.
        - Gazell GCC board examples startup and run correctly with the GCC libraries.
        - A Gazell Device nows stop the RSSI measurement when no ACK is received, improving the base current consumption.

    - Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
         On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
         Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
         
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it.
    
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power
    
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing a software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        (implies to wake-up the current application from SYTEM_OFF before flashing a new application)
    ANT
        - ARCH-506 - ANT-FS host; download could fail when downloading large files.
        
        - NRFFOSDK-484 - HRM TX background pages are not following 65th packet rule according to spec
 
    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized
        
        - NRFFOSDK-361 - System attributes are stored in flash only after disconnect.
        
        - NRFFOSDK-472 - Bonding information in flash are not erased during programming of a new application 
            If the bonding information are not erased manually - by pressing button 1 during start-up - the new application might assert. 
            
        - NRFFOSDK-486 - All applications using bond manager will assert when the maximum number of bonded masters is passed 
            For more information, see proximity application documentation. 



    Proprietary:
        - ESB/Gazell: Calling nrf_esb_init() or nrf_gzll_init() will disable usage of the GPIOTE peripheral. 
        
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the
            nRF51 examples:
            hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
            hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
            hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
            hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the
            payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
          
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Notification ANT:
    - This is last release that will support N51422 QFAACA (ANT). Next release will contain API changes.

        - GZP: nrf_nvmc_write_bytes correctly iterates through bytes.

Fixed issues:
    - Examples use deprecated PERPOWER register. 

    Proprietary:
        - When using Keil ARM MDK v4.60 the ram retention, temperature and blinky examples might fail during compilation.
        - Gazell and ESB examples point to wrong SFR file (should be SFD\Nordic\nRF51\nRF51822.sfr). 

    Bluetooth:
          - The buttons on the evaluation board are not debounced.

Known issues:
    - Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi. 
      Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it. (DRGN-1807)
    - Reset button won't work after programing without cycling the target power. (DRGN-1885)
    - Flashing a software using SEGGER is possible only when NOT in SYSTEM_OFF mode (implies to wake-up the current application with a button press for example before flashing a new application).(DRGN-1925)
      
    Bluetooth:
        - Only the ..\sdk\nrf5822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\ and ..\sdk\nrf5822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ applications are power optimized.(DRGN-1914)
        - ble_bondmngr_store_bonded_masters function from the bond manager cannot be used when advertising nor when in a connection (DRGN-1915)
         (flash erase/write prevents the CPU from running which means the stack will not be able to run properly.) 
          If ble_bondmngr_store_bonded_masters function is called while advertising or in a connection, the behavior is UNDEFINED.

    Proprietary:
        - ESB/Gazell: Calling nrf_esb_init() or nrf_gzll_init() will disable usage of the GPIOTE peripheral. In order to use the GPIOTE peripheral, the workaround in PAN 22 must be performed after calling these functions.         
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.

        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready
          SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
        - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".

          hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
          hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);

          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the
          payloads received in ACK.  

        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible 
          with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx
          devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects,
          or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects
          (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, 
          or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).







nRF518 SDK v1.1.1
-----------------

Changes:
- Master Control Panel updated to version 3.1.1. Includes fix for issue where pca10000 master emulator devices did not get detected.

Known issues:
- When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it.
- When using Keil ARM MDK v4.60 the ram retention, temperature and blinky examples might fail during compilation and leave an error message like this:
    C3900U: Unrecognized option '--asm'.
    C3900U: Unrecognized option '--interleave'.
  To fix this Click Alt+F7, choose "Listing" tab. Uncheck "C Compiler Listing" 
- Previous issues from v1.1.0 does still apply

Known issues:
- Examples use depracated PERPOWER register. Future silicon will power up peripherals after reset and PERPOWER register will be removed.
- Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
- Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in

- Gazell and ESB examples point to wrong SFR file (should be SFD\Nordic\nRF51\nRF51822.sfr). 
- Reset button wont work after programing without cycling the target power. Workaround is to update system_nrf51.c with 
  void SystemInit (void) 
  {
      /* Switch ON both RAM banks */
      NRF_POWER->RESET = POWER_RESET_RESET_Enabled;
      NRF_POWER->RAMON |= (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM0_RAM0On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM0_Pos) |
                          (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_RAM1On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_Pos);
  } 

Bluetooth:
  - The button on the evaluation board are not debounced in hardware and the application implementing for it does not debounce the button presses either (using software mechanisms). So there will be additional increments/decrements of heart rate measurement while pressing the buttons.

- Windows 7 SP1 64-bit

Changes:
- Added Bicycle Power minimal slave example.
- Added Stride and Distance Monitor minimal slave and master example.
- Removed deprecated PERPOWER register from examples and header files.

Known issues:
- Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
- On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
  - Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
- When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it.
- Flashing a software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode (implies to wake-up the current application from SYTEM_OFF before flashing a new application)
- Reset button won't work after programming with Keil without cycling the target power. On the other hand if nrfjprog with -p (pin reset) is used to program the device, reset button will work.
- Using -p option in nrfjprog too heavily might block JLink. This block can be resolved by re-cycling the JLink power.


nRF514 SDK v1.1.0
-----------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.54
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10001 module
- N51422 QFAACA on a PCA10005 modulea on nRF6310 motherboard

Known issues:

                          (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_RAM1On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_Pos);
  } 
- Spi master function spi_master_init() sends two dummy bytes. This will be removed in a future release.
- timer_example nrf_timer_delay_ms() will not give expected results using parameter values over 65 ms.

Changes:
- First public release
